## Tinder Questions Repository 

This repository has analysis of my Tinder history. 

One set of analysis looks into the effect of the first remark on the length of the conversation. It would be reasonable to believe that custom, interesting first messages are more likely to entice a response and a longer conversation. Using my personal data, I want to validate this theory.

Due to the data restrictions, I only have my side of the conversation. 

I have found that there is no difference in having a long conversation whether I start the conversation with a generic "hey how's it going" and a more elaborate first remark. I found no statistical difference between the two groups long conversation rate and that short message may increase long conversation rates by 0.17% with 50% probability.
